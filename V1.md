Introduction:

Malware continues to be a significant threat to computer systems and networks worldwide. Attackers use various tactics to infiltrate systems, including brute force attacks, malware, and social engineering. The WpBruteBot malware family is one such example of an attack that utilizes brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access to WordPress sites. In this report, we will analyze a sample from the WpBruteBot family to understand its behavior and potential impact on systems.

The sample was analyzed using a custom spectrogram classifier, which predicted a likelihood of 0.46995583176612854 of the sample being malicious. Additionally, the sample was submitted to VirusTotal, and none of the engines detected it as malicious. This discrepancy in predictions highlights the importance of conducting thorough analysis to understand the true nature of malware samples.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the WpBruteBot sample. We will examine its behavior, potential impact, and any indicators of compromise that may be present. By understanding the inner workings of this malware, we can better protect our systems and networks from similar attacks in the future.

The malware exhibits a range of capabilities in terms of its behavior. It contains a loop and has the ability to delay execution, which it achieves through the use of kernel32.Sleep. It also contains anti-analysis techniques, including the ability to target strings such as "ida[gqtuw]?(.exe)?$" and anti-VM strings targeting Xen. The malware contains a resource (.rsrc) section and an embedded PE file, which it can use to install additional programs. It can also get common file paths and use absolute stream paths on Windows. The malware can set the current directory, create and delete directories, and delete files. It can check if a file exists, get the disk size, create and terminate processes, and link functions at runtime on Windows. It can link many functions at runtime, with at least five instances of api(kernel32.GetProcAddress). Overall, the malware exhibits a range of capabilities that allow it to evade analysis and detection, install additional programs, and manipulate the file system and processes on the host.

Dynamic analysis is an essential technique used to analyze the behavior of malware and identify its capabilities. In this case, we have identified several domains, IPs, and URLs that are associated with the malware under analysis. The domains include dl2.tlauncher.org, which appears to be the primary domain used by the malware. Other domains include 104.219.191.52.in-addr.arpa, 95.221.229.192.in-addr.arpa, and 154.239.44.20.in-addr.arpa. These domains are used by the malware to communicate with the command and control (C2) server.

The IPs associated with the malware include 8.8.8.8, 104.20.234.70, 104.20.235.70, and 40.77.2.164. These IPs are used by the malware to connect to the C2 server and receive commands. Other IPs include 95.101.78.82, 173.223.113.164, 173.223.113.131, and 204.79.197.203. These IPs are likely to be used by the attackers to host the C2 server and manage the malware.

The URLs associated with the malware include https://dl2.tlauncher.org/check_latest_tl.php?optime=0. This URL is used by the malware to download updates and new versions of the malware. The attackers can use this URL to push new versions of the malware with updated capabilities and features.

The Yara rule used in this analysis is 'upx.' This rule is used to detect the presence of the UPX packer, which is commonly used by attackers to compress and obfuscate the malware. The presence of this rule indicates that the malware is likely to be packed with UPX.

The TTPs associated with the malware include T1112, T1082, and T1012. T1112 refers to the use of code signing certificates to sign the malware and evade detection. T1082 refers to the use of system information discovery techniques to gather information about the infected system. T1012 refers to the use of a web service to communicate with the C2 server and receive commands.

In conclusion, the dynamic analysis of the malware has revealed several domains, IPs, and URLs associated with the malware. The Yara rule 'upx' indicates that the malware is likely to be packed with UPX. The TTPs associated with the malware include code signing, system information discovery, and the use of a web service to communicate with the C2 server. These findings can be used to develop indicators of compromise (IOCs) and improve malware detection and prevention capabilities.
Based on the dynamic analysis, it is evident that the malware is associated with several IPs, including 8.8.8.8, 104.20.234.70, 104.20.235.70, and 40.77.2.164. These IPs may be used by the attackers to control and manage the malware remotely. The URLs and domains associated with the malware are also important as they may provide clues to the origin of the attack and help in identifying the attackers. The TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) used by the attackers include obfuscation, UPX packing, and loop delay, which are all aimed at evading detection and analysis. Overall, the malware exhibits a range of capabilities that enable it to install additional programs, manipulate the file system and processes on the host, and evade analysis and detection. It is crucial to stay vigilant and keep security systems up-to-date to prevent malware attacks and protect critical systems and data.
